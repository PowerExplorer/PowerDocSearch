<P>Version 3, 19 November 2007</P>
<P>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http://fsf.org/</P>
<P>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of
this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</P>
<P>Preamble</P>
<P>The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license
for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to
ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server
software.</P>
<P>The licenses for most software and other practical works are
designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By
contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure
it remains free software for all its users.</P>
<P>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</P>
<P>Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your
rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2)
offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.</P>
<P>A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.</P>
<P>The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes
available to the community. It requires the operator of a network
server to provide the source code of the modified version running
there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a
modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public
access to the source code of the modified version.</P>
<P>An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This
is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero
has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits
relicensing under this license.</P>
<P>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</P>
<P>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</P>
<P>0. Definitions.</P>
<P>&quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero
General Public License.</P>
<P>&quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to
other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.</P>
<P>&quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed
under this License. Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
&quot;Licensees&quot; and &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals
or organizations.</P>
<P>To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or
part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other
than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a
&quot;modified version&quot; of the earlier work or a work &quot;based
on&quot; the earlier work.</P>
<P>A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or
a work based on the Program.</P>
<P>To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that,
without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.</P>
<P>To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that
enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction
with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy,
is not conveying.</P>
<P>An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal
Notices&quot; to the extent that it includes a convenient and
prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate
copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty
for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to
view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user
commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list
meets this criterion.</P>
<P>1. Source Code.</P>
<P>The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of
the work for making modifications to it. &quot;Object code&quot;
means any non-source form of a work.</P>
<P>A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is
an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
language.</P>
<P>The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include
anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the
normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of
that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work
with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for
which an implementation is available to the public in source code
form. A &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major
essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs,
or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter
used to run it.</P>
<P>The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code
form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for
an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work,
including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not
include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or
generally available free programs which are used unmodified in
performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For
example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
associated with source files for the work, and the source code for
shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
parts of the work.</P>
<P>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.</P>
<P>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.</P>
<P>2. Basic Permissions.</P>
<P>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</P>
<P>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply
with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which
you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the
covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under
your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making
any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship
with you.</P>
<P>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.</P>
<P>Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.</P>
<P>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</P>
<P>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.</P>
<P>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to
forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,
against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to
forbid circumvention of technological measures.</P>
<P>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</P>
<P>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</P>
<P>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you
convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</P>
<P>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</P>
<P>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications
to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:</P>
<P>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
it, and giving a relevant date.</P>
<P>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.
This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to &quot;keep
intact all notices&quot;.</P>
<P>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License
will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional
terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how
they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the
work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if
you have separately received it.</P>
<P>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
need not make them do so.</P>
<P>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and
independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the
covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a
larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its
resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.</P>
<P>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</P>
<P>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, in one of these ways:</P>
<P>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange.</P>
<P>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or
(2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at
no charge.</P>
<P>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative
is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
subsection 6b.</P>
<P>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy
the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be
on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that
supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
directions next to the object code saying where to find the
Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</P>
<P>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
provided you inform other peers where the object code and
Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general
public at no charge under subsection 6d.</P>
<P>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not
be included in conveying the object code work.</P>
<P>A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer
product&quot;, which means any tangible personal property which is
normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2)
anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In
determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases
shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product
received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the
status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular
user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A
product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has
substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such
uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.</P>
<P>&quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any
methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information
required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work
in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
interfered with solely because modification has been made.</P>
<P>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs
as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of
the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for
a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized),
the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be
accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement
does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability
to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the
work has been installed in ROM).</P>
<P>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed
by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the
modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of
the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication
across the network.</P>
<P>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
public in source code form), and must require no special password or
key for unpacking, reading or copying.</P>
<P>7. Additional Terms.</P>
<P>&quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the
terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire
Program shall be treated as though they were included in this
License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If
additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part
may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire
Program remains governed by this License without regard to the
additional permissions.</P>
<P>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
terms:</P>
<P>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring
preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation
of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions
of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the
original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of
names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to
grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,
trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of
licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the
material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of
liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.</P>
<P>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further
restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program
as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.</P>
<P>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section,
you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.</P>
<P>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.</P>
<P>8. Termination.</P>
<P>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).</P>
<P>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.</P>
<P>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.</P>
<P>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not
permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
for the same material under section 10.</P>
<P>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</P>
<P>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.</P>
<P>Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy
likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than
this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered
work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this
License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</P>
<P>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</P>
<P>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</P>
<P>An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring
control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or
subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation
of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to
that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives
whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had
or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to
possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the
predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with
reasonable efforts.</P>
<P>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion
of it.</P>
<P>11. Patents.</P>
<P>A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use
under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is
based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's
&quot;contributor version&quot;.</P>
<P>A contributor's &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent
claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already
acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some
manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
contributor version. For purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot;
includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent
with the requirements of this License.</P>
<P>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent
claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,
modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.</P>
<P>In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is
any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent
or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To &quot;grant&quot;
such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.</P>
<P>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
License, through a publicly available network server or other readily
accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding
Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the
benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3)
arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.
&quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have actual knowledge that,
but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a
country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country,
would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that
you have reason to believe are valid.</P>
<P>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent
license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the
covered work and works based on it.</P>
<P>A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not
include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of,
or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights
that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey
a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
party that is in the business of distributing software, under which
you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your
activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from
you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of
the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies),
or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or
compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into
that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28
March 2007.</P>
<P>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or
limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that
may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</P>
<P>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</P>
<P>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.
If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For
example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty
for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be
to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</P>
<P>13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public
License.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify
the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your
version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the
Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some
standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This
Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any
work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is
incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by
version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</P>
<P>14. Revised Versions of this License.</P>
<P>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</P>
<P>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero
General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to
it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
of that numbered version or of any later version published by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</P>
<P>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.</P>
<P>Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.</P>
<P>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</P>
<P>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.</P>
<P>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.</P>
<P>16. Limitation of Liability.</P>
<P>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.</P>
<P>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</P>
<P>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.</P>
<P>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</P>
<P>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</P>
<P>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is
to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change
under these terms.</P>
<P>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where
the full notice is found.</P>
<P>1. Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;</P>
<P>1. This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as
published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the
License, or (at your option) any later version.</P>
<P>2.</P>
<P>3. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
Affero General Public License for more details.</P>
<P>4.</P>
<P>5. You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General
Public License along with this program.</P>
<P>If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.</P>
<P>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.</P>
<P>If your software can interact with users remotely through a
computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way
for users to get its source. For example, if your program is a web
application, its interface could display a &quot;Source&quot; link
that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways you
could offer source, and different solutions will be better for
different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.</P>
<P>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the
program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply
and follow the GNU AGPL, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/ .</P>

<P><B>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</B></P>
<P>Version 2, June 1991</P>
<P>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
</P>
<P>51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA</P>
<P>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of
this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</P>
<P>Preamble</P>
<P>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered
by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it
to your programs, too.</P>
<P>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can
get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces
of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these
things.</P>
<P>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</P>
<P>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.</P>
<P>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</P>
<P>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this
free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed
on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the
original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
on the original authors' reputations.</P>
<P>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that
any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed
at all.</P>
<P>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</P>
<P>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</P>
<P>0. This License applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The
&quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a
&quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term
&quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</P>
<P>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</P>
<P>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this
License along with the Program.</P>
<P>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for
a fee.</P>
<P>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</P>
<P>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</P>
<P>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
under the terms of this License.</P>
<P>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
is not required to print an announcement.)</P>
<P>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.</P>
<P>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
derivative or collective works based on the Program.</P>
<P>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
work under the scope of this License.</P>
<P>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
following:</P>
<P>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
or,</P>
<P>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,</P>
<P>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection b above.)</P>
<P>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used
to control compilation and installation of the executable. However,
as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.</P>
<P>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</P>
<P>4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.</P>
<P>5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.</P>
<P>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on
the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties to this License.</P>
<P>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.
If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For
example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Program.</P>
<P>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in
other circumstances.</P>
<P>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.</P>
<P>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</P>
<P>8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</P>
<P>9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</P>
<P>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to
it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</P>
<P>10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to
the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted
by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will
be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
reuse of software generally.</P>
<P>NO WARRANTY</P>
<P>11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</P>
<P>12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.</P>
